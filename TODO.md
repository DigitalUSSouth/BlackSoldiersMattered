# TODO and Concerns

1. What is the timeline for the 'Soldier's Journey' Map?
(We don't need specific dates for testing.)
2. What are we pulling for map coordinates?
	- geoJSON objects
	- approximate locations (polygons)
	- GPS coordinates 

3. Source files to add in the repo (which are currently outsourced online)
	- leaflet 	
	- vis.min
	- jquery (probably already have this)

4. Add conditional js/jquery to header/footer to map pages to
improve load times

5. Create new test data
6. Add clickable marker (not the map)
7. I have creted my own mapbox ID for now, need to create a generic(project) one.
